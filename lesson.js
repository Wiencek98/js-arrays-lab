// Arrays are just a contain zero or more items called elements
//

//const nums [2,4, 6,] --- the [] is what makes an array

// const movies = ['Barbie', 'Interstellar', 'Get Out']; --- there is 3 elements
//const firstMovie = movies[0];
// firstMovie is 'Barbie

//console.log(movies.length); --- .length will give you the access to the number of elements
// `3` is logged to the console

// Using length to access the last element of an array
//const lastMovie = movies[movies.length - 1];
// lastMovie is 'Get Out'
